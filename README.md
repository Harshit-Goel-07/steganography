# Image Steganography Tool

## Overview
This project is an **Image Steganography Tool** that allows users to **hide and retrieve secret messages within images**. Using Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the tool provides a secure way to conceal information inside image pixels without visible changes.

## Features
- **Hide Messages** â€“ Encode text within an image without altering its appearance.
- **Extract Messages** â€“ Retrieve the hidden text from a steganographic image.
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ A simple web-based frontend for ease of use.
- **Secure Communication** â€“ Enhances privacy by making messages invisible to unauthorized users.

## Technologies Used
### **Programming Language**
- Python â€“ For implementing the steganography logic.

### **Libraries & Frameworks**
- OpenCV â€“ Image processing.

### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ For building a responsive web interface.

### **Platforms & Tools**
- VS Code â€“ For coding and testing.
- GitHub â€“ Version control and project management.

## Installation & Usage
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshit-Goel-07/steganography.git
cd image-steganography-tool
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then install required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
```

### **3. Run the Backend**
```bash
python app.py
```

### **4. Open Frontend**
Open `index.html` in a web browser to interact with the tool.


## Future Scope
- **Support for More File Types** â€“ Extending beyond images to hide messages in audio/video files.
- **Web Deployment** â€“ Hosting the tool online for easy accessibility.

## Conclusion
This project provides a **simple yet effective solution for secure communication** using image steganography. By combining an intuitive interface with powerful backend logic, it ensures that sensitive information remains hidden in plain sight.
